# Customer Churn - Churn Prediction model

# Description

The objective of this project is to predict behavior to retain customers, analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or service during a certain time frame. You can calculate churn rate by dividing the number of customers  lost during that time period by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

This Project code contains visualizations and RandomForestClassifier model to detect customers. The model is evaluated using Precision and AUC-ROC curve

# Energy Prediction

Significant investments are being made to improve building efficiencies to reduce costs and emissions. The question is, are the improvements working? That’s where you come in. Under pay-for-performance financing, the building owner makes payments based on the difference between their real energy consumption and what they would have used without any retrofits. The latter values have to come from a model. Current methods of estimation are fragmented and do not scale well. Some assume a specific meter type or don’t work with different building types.

This model predicts energy usage from the historical data available.
