What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or service during a certain time frame. You can calculate churn rate by dividing the number of customers  lost during that time period by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

This Project code contains visualizations and RandomForestClassifier model to detect customers. The model is evaluated using Precision and AUC-ROC curve
